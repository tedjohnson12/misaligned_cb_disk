Misaligned Circumbinary Disks
-----------------------------

Ever wondered what happens to a circumbinary
disk as it settles? They (and the planets that the form)
generally end up coplanar to the binary -- prograde 
and retrograde orbits -- or circumpolar -- i.e. with an 
orbital plane perpendicular to that of the binary.

We can approximate a disk with a massive third body initialized
into a keplerian orbit about the binary center of mass. The
procession of that orbit will tell us about the behavior of
a disk with the same parameters.

This code provides a framework to use the N-body code REBOUND
to do experiements with this setup.
